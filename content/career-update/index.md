title: "Career Update"
---

I'm in the process of resigning from my software engineering job and from September I'll commit myself full-time to pursuing BSc. in Mathematics at ETH Zürich. I've been working on reaching this level of education for the last six years and I am grateful to be given a chance to pursue it further. 

In August 2024, after taking two months off from full-time software engineering work, I passed all examination sessions of the Schweizerische Maturitätsprüfung. I was tested, through both written and oral exams, on the entire curriculum studied in a Swiss Gymnasium: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics (base level), Applied Mathematics and Physics (advanced level, DE: Schwerpunktfach Physik und Anwendungen der Mathematik), German (first language), English (advanced level), Italian (base level), Geography, History, and Visual Arts. Additionally, I presented my Diploma Thesis ([Maturaarbeit](./assets/Maturaarbeit.pdf)), which explored various approaches to compressing nucleotide sequences. I successfully passed all subjects on my first attempt, with the exception of Visual Arts, and I am now qualified to start my studies at ETH Zürich.

I would like to thank my mother, who raised me on her own, and my girlfriend Elena, for their unwavering love and support. I'm also grateful to all my mentors, teachers, and private tutors for their patience, encouragement, and for pushing me to think more deeply, quickly, and communicate more clearly. I would like to thank my friends who understood and accepted my decisions to say "no" to countless opportunities and events, recognizing my long-term vision.

I firmly believe that the rigor, discipline, and intellectual curiosity demanded by ETH Zürich and the education it provides will shape me into a better thinker, engineer, and technical leader than any other growth opportunity available.

See you at ETHZ.
